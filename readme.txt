Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

This custom WordPress plugin allows administrators to manage user capabilities with precision. Instead of creating new roles, it focuses on modifying the existing capabilities of listed users. Key features include:

* Assign or remove specific permissions for listed users.
* Manage capabilities like editing posts, managing plugins, or accessing admin areas.
* Ensure security by limiting sensitive actions to authorized users only.
* User-friendly interface for selecting and updating user capabilities.
* Designed to improve workflow control without altering the role structure.

This plugin is perfect for teams that need granular control over user actions while maintaining a streamlined role hierarchy.
